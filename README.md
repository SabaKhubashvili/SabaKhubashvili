 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
 
Greetings! I'm a front-end developer by the name of Saba Khubashvili, and I've worked on both front-end and back-end projects. Three years ago, I enrolled in a web development program at Ug Limes, which marked the beginning of my foray into the world of web development. I developed a strong foundation in web development principles and learnt the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during this program.

Since then, I've been developing my knowledge and skills while working on a variety of web development projects to obtain real-world experience. Now that I've advanced, I'm building personal websites and working as a freelancer.

Using my expertise in React, Typescript, and Tailwind, I design responsive, interactive, and intuitive websites with a focus on user-friendly interfaces. I like working on challenging projects that let me experiment with new tools and methods.

In addition to web development, UI/UX design is another area of interest for me, and I'm always trying to get better at it. I work hard to apply the best design techniques in all of my projects because I think that excellent design is crucial to producing wonderful user experiences.

I'm grateful that you took the time to look over my GitHub portfolio. Please feel free to contact me if you have any inquiries or would want to talk about prospective projects or collaborations.
